location: Remote

I currently edit all of my videos by myself. I'm looking for someone who can help me edit on a regular basis.

I'm aiming for 2-4 videos per month where you'd have a minimum of 1 week to edit the video.

You'll be an integral part of the channel and help me expirement with new styles of content.

We'll make more of the tech videos I've always created but also learn how to make great coding/software-focused content.

#### About you

- You are passionate about making videos and technology
- You're humble and eager to constantly learn and improve based on feedback
- You're entrepreneurial and eager to be a part of building something for the long-term

#### Location

This will start as a remote position but you'll have the opportunity to work in person with me in the future.

#### Compensation

This is a contrast position and you'll be paid a flat fee per video. We can also discuss a percentage of the channel's revenue.

#### How to apply

Reach out to Cole at [cole@caccamedia.com](mailto:cole@caccamedia.com) with the job title in the subject line.

Send me links to your best work and ideas you have for the channel.

If you're a good fit we'll schedule a call and plan a trial run of 1-2 videos (that will be paid).
