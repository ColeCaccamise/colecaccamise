title: How I Make Time To Code (even with a full time job)

I know that a big struggle many of you have is finding time to work on side projects.

For the first few years I was coding I 100% had the time, but I wanted the conditions to be perfect.

I would only work on a project if i could have multiple hours uninterrupted.

This meant that I’d go weeks without ever touching my editor.

Something I really resonate with is **‘no zero days’** - never taking a day off, no matter if you just put 5 minutes in.

Taking a day off here and there feels like no big deal.

But when you’re trying to make significant progress, consistency over a long period of time is the most important thing.

So every day, write just a single line of code.

Often that turns into a flow state where you write one hundred.

That’s my most tactical advice to my younger self.

**I’d also tell him to have a project to work on with a deadline.**

I’ve found that I work best when I know there’s a time it needs to be done by.

Especially when working alone on a project, this prevents you from over-scoping.

If you only have a month to launch a side project, you don’t have time to add more features or ‘polish’.

This is the only reason I finally shipped my MVP.

I don’t (yet) have a launch date for my v1, so progress has been significantly slower.

I know the moment I give myself a date to launch on Product Hunt (leaning towards October), i’ll be much more efficient.

The last piece of advice I’d leave my younger self with is to **learn his tools**.

Memorizing keyboard shortcuts and knowing how to save time in your editor makes coding more fun.

Finding the tricks to save a few seconds here and there compounds (and makes you feel badass).

I made a video talking about the apps and tools I have on my Mac as a developer that I love.

Have a great week.
