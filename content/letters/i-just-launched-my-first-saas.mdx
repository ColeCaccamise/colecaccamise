After 3 months of building, I'm finally launching Creator Kiwi.

Today, I'm beginning to open spots in the private beta.

I've been dogfooding the product myself for the last few weeks and I'm starting to find real value from it.

Honestly, it doesn't feel ready, but getting raw feedback is becoming my biggest bottleneck in making this a great product.

I've talked about launching a SaaS for years at this point, but I never felt ready or like I had the right idea.

I started Creator Kiwi to get over that fear and prove that literally anyone can do this.

It solves a problem I've had myself, and I believe others will find it valuable.

Currently, it's able to:

- Quickly generate short links associated with specific videos
- Save links so you can re use them in _seconds_ later
- Automatically track conversions from links with Lemon Squeezy and Kit
- See the common patterns among your audience (i.e. what links they've engaged with)

I have huge visions for what this can become, but my current focus is to make it valuable for other builders and people sharing their work on the internet.

You can read the announcement post [here](https://creatorkiwi.com/blog/meet-creatorkiwi) and [sign up](https://creator.kiwi/muv8gv7) for free today.

If you sign up, reply with the email you used and I'll give you access.

Thank you for coming on this journey with me. I hope you find value from it.
