[Alienware 32" 4K 240 Hz Monitor](https://caccamise.link/alienware) - The best monitor I've ever gamed on. The picture quality is fantastic and the refresh rate is insane for games that can push it.

[Lian Li O11 Dynamic Mini](https://caccamise.link/pc-case) - I've used this case for a couple of years now and like it. Always has been easy to build in.

[RTX 4080 Gigabyte Eagle OC](https://caccamise.link/4080) - An overpriced but powerful card. Runs RT at 100 FPS w/ DLSS 3 in most titles.

[i7 13700K](https://caccamise.link/13700k) - This could probably use an upgrade but I haven't had any issues.

[Kraken 280mm Cooler](https://caccamise.link/kraken) - I've had the x62 since I built my first PC in 2019. It still runs well.

[Lian Li Fans](https://caccamise.link/fans) - These look great with the O11.

[Spider-Man Funko](https://caccamise.link/future-foundation) - Your friendly neighborhood funko pop.

[MSI Motherboard](https://caccamise.link/motherboard) - Sleak design. It's a motherboard.

[Trident Z Royal RAM (32GB)](https://caccamise.link/ram) - Gorgeous RAM.

[1000W SFX PSU](https://caccamise.link/psu) - One of the few SFX PSU's with this capacity.

[1TB Intel SSD](https://caccamise.link/intel-ssd) - Great value-for-money M.2.

[1TB Samsung SSD](https://caccamise.link/samsung-ssd) - A fast drive.

### VR

[Meta Quest 3](https://creator.kiwi/kbdCjsZ) - I use the quest for a couple of standalone games but mostly as a wireless PCVR headset. I just upgraded from the 2 and am loving it. The display quality is a bit better and full color passthrough is great.

[Virtual Desktop](https://creator.kiwi/1wHOvVX) - A PC streaming app that I've found to be more stable and higher quality than Quest Link. I'd recommend connecting your PC to your router over ethernet if possible.

[BoboVR M3 Pro Head Strap](https://creator.kiwi/s8M8EyY) - A must-have accessory imo. I hated the default strap from the Quest 2 and imagined the 3 would feel similar. This distributes the weight really well - I have no problems wearing it for hours.

[BOBOVR B2 Battery Pack](https://creator.kiwi/ZwEVx74) - Slaps onto the back of the head strap. I cycle these as I'm playing and it extends the headset battery life significantly. With 2 or 3 of these you could literally play all day.

### Games I'm Playing

[Batman: Arkham Shadow](https://creator.kiwi/ChCFmYg) - A big reason I bought the Quest 3 (my bundle came with it). This game is phenomenal, by far the best VR game I've tried. The story is great, the world is immersive, and combat is fun (after some getting used to).

[Vertigo Remastered](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318090/Vertigo_Remastered/) - A great sci-fi PCVR game. It took a lot of inspiration from Half-Life but in a good way. The world feels unique and the gameplay is fun.

[Lost Records: Bloom and Rage](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/) - Made by the original developers of Life is Strange. I'm a big fan of these kind of story-driven games.

[DEATH IN UNISON](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2454890/DEATH_IN_UNISON/) - Stumbled across this looking for a co-op horror hame. It's very unique and a ton of fun with a friend.
