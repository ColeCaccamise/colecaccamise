[Alienware 32" 4K 240 Hz Monitor](https://caccamise.link/alienware) - The best monitor I've ever gamed on. The picture quality is fantastic and the refresh rate is insane for games that can push it.

[Lian Li O11 Dynamic Mini](https://caccamise.link/pc-case) - I've used this case for a couple of years now and like it. Always has been easy to build in.

[RTX 4080 Gigabyte Eagle OC](https://caccamise.link/4080) - An overpriced but powerful card. Runs RT at 100 FPS w/ DLSS 3 in most titles.

[i7 13700K](https://caccamise.link/13700k) - This could probably use an upgrade but I haven't had any issues.

[Kraken 280mm Cooler](https://caccamise.link/kraken) - I've had the x62 since I built my first PC in 2019. It still runs well.

[Lian Li Fans](https://caccamise.link/fans) - These look great with the O11.

[Spider-Man Funko](https://caccamise.link/future-foundation) - Your friendly neighborhood funko pop.

[MSI Motherboard](https://caccamise.link/motherboard) - Sleak design. It's a motherboard.

[Trident Z Royal RAM (32GB)](https://caccamise.link/ram) - Gorgeous RAM.

[1000W SFX PSU](https://caccamise.link/psu) - One of the few SFX PSU's with this capacity.

[1TB Intel SSD](https://caccamise.link/intel-ssd) - Great value-for-money M.2.

[1TB Samsung SSD](https://caccamise.link/samsung-ssd) - A fast drive.
